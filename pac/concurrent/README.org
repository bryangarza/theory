* Notes on Concurrent Haskell

- An =MVar= is a /one-place channel/, which means that it can be used for passing
  messages between threads, but it can hold at most one message at a time.
- An =MVar= is a /container for shared mutable state/. For example, a common
  design pattern in Concurrent Haskell, when several threads need read and write
  access to some state, is to represent the state value as an ordinary immutable
  Haskell data structure stored in an =MVar=. Modifying the state consists of
  taking the current value with =takeMVar= (which implicity acquires a lock),
  and then placing a new value back in the MVar with putMVar (which implicitly
  releases the lock again).

  Sometimes the mutable state is not a Haskell data structure; it might be
  stored in C code or on the filesystem, for example. In such cases, we can use
  an =MVar= with a dummy value such as =()= to act as a lock on the external
  state, where =takeMVar= acquires the lock and =putMVar= releases it again.

- An =MVar= is a /building block/ for constructing larger concurrent
  Datastructures.
